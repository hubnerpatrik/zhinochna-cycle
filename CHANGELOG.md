## 0.10.6 — In development

### Changed

- Give main screens and day editors individual hash URLs with browser Back/Forward support.
- Restore the selected map and editor date from the URL after refresh; validate missing maps and invalid routes.
- Return profile and create-map Back buttons to the previous page, with a safe fallback for direct links.
- Route map creation and opening through the same navigation path so header state stays consistent.
- Remove delayed editor transitions and animation-dependent save callbacks; keep the calendar month when returning from an editor.
- Match the Profile and Actions heading sizes.

### Fixed

- Hide header navigation reliably during initial profile setup.
- Reject inherited object properties as map IDs.

### Validation

- Regression tests cover browser history, refresh, map switching, missing maps, invalid dates, setup guards, and modal cleanup without animation events.
- Existing persistence, backup/import, chart and cycle-calculation tests remain in place. No storage-format migration is required.

## 0.10.5 — 2026-09-02

### Added

- Added a Cancel button to the Cross cells action pill so an unfinished selection can be discarded directly from the pill.
- Made both Coverlines fully adjustable: each line can be moved and each endpoint can be dragged independently to change its length or break and rebuild the L shape.

### Changed

- Limited the chart scale, temperature entry, imported measurements, crossed cells, and Coverline positions to 36.00–37.40 °C.
- Gave selected fertile and period calendar days soft green and red gradients at 30% opacity.
- Changed Save Map to persist the active map without closing it or leaving the chart, with a confirmation message after saving.

## 0.10.4 — 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Limited temperature entry, imported measurements, crossed temperature cells, and the chart scale to 36–38 °C.
- Split the application entry point and UI layer into smaller feature modules without changing the user workflow.
- Consolidated styling behind one CSS entry point while keeping base and theme rules maintainable.
- Strengthened persisted-data normalization and observation validation.

### Fixed

- Made cycle-day calculations safe across daylight-saving time changes.
- Restored in-memory state to the last durable snapshot when browser persistence fails.
- Preserved unfinished chart-tool state after failed saves and consistently cleared transient modes when resetting or changing screens.
- Removed duplicate active-map persistence and other dead or duplicated state paths.
- Returned directly to the chart after saving a marker instead of opening the Edit Day menu.
- Updated the marker field heading to match the selected BBT, mucus, or cervix peak type.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for DST boundaries, malformed imported observations, persistence rollbacks, and transient chart state.
- Verified the release with 57 automated tests, a production build, and an isolated browser smoke test.

## 0.10.3 — 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Centralized chart interaction cleanup so Coverlines, crossed cells, and marker modes reset consistently when switching tools or screens.
- Simplified restore flows while preserving validation, persistence, and transient selection cleanup.
- Reused calculated cycle starts when building chart columns and consolidated repeated day-entry updates.

### Fixed

- Cycle identifiers now advance only when a new cycle start occurs.

## 0.10.2 — 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Coverlines can now be dragged by either arm or moved together from their shared corner while retaining their existing L shape; vertical coverlines snap to both cell edges and centers.
- The Coverlines button now creates the complete L shape with one chart click and shows a bottom-center placement hint.
- Cross-cell selection now adds a Save control to its bottom instruction pill instead of using a confirmation modal.
- Instruction pills for Coverlines, Cross cells, and Markers remain visible until their action is completed or cancelled.
- Existing Coverlines can be selected for a highlighted drag state and deleted as a complete L shape from the bottom action pill.
- A selected Coverline is deselected when the user clicks away from it.

## 0.10.1 — 2026-08-20

### Changed

- Calendar opens on the latest month represented in the active map, falling back to the local current month for empty maps.
- Crossed temperature-chart cells now use green lines.
- Horizontal and vertical coverlines meet at a shared origin and render as an L shape.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-08-18

### Added

- Per-map JSON backup export with saved author profiles and cycle observations.
- Shared-map import that preserves the recipient's profile and existing maps.
- Validation of imported application data.
- User-facing import and export controls in My Maps.
- Git contribution, release, and CI conventions.
- Two-branch workflow with stable `main` and working `develop`.

### Changed

- Refactored browser persistence behind a dedicated local-storage adapter.
- Improved resilience when loading persisted application state.
- Added pastel styling for map export and delete actions.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-08-17

### Added

- Shared `core.js` utilities and dependency-free unit tests.
- Automated syntax, test, and production-build checks.

### Changed

* Refactored shared utilities out of feature-specific modules.
* Hardened profile and map persistence against malformed local data.
* Improved cycle boundary detection for sparse observations.
* Removed circular imports from chart rendering.
* Simplified map controls and removed deprecated cycle navigation controls.
* Updated the chart to display all columns of the current map.
* Unified buttons, typography, spacing, cards, navigation, and modal layouts.
* Refined the pastel visual design across the application.
* Improved desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.
* Improved calendar readability on narrow screens.
* Improved map action layouts for touch devices.
* Improved modal centering, scrolling, and short-screen behavior.
* Added safe-area handling for mobile devices with display cutouts.
* Prevented unintended horizontal page overflow.

### Security

- Rendered day notes and custom observation text with text nodes.
- Escaped map identifiers used in HTML attributes.

## [0.8.0]

- Previous active-prototype milestone. Earlier changes remain available in Git history.
