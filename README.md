# Cycle Tracker

### Symptothermal cycle tracking, built around observation rather than prediction.

A browser-based application for recording daily cycle observations and reviewing them on a clear, traditional-style symptothermal map.

## About

Cycle Tracker brings the structure of a paper symptothermal chart into a digital interface.

The app combines **basal body temperature, bleeding, cervical mucus, cervix observations, fertile days, markers and additional symptoms** in one synchronized view. It is designed as a **manual interpretation tool**: the application organizes and visualizes the data, while the user remains responsible for interpreting it.

It does **not** predict ovulation, assign fertility scores or automatically decide what the cycle data means.

> **Current status:** Active prototype · v0.10.6 (in development)

Each main screen has its own URL (`#/menu`, `#/my-profile`, `#/my-maps`,
`#/create-map`, and `#/active-map?map=…`). Day editors also have history entries,
so browser Back/Forward and the in-app Back buttons return through the screens
you visited. Refreshing an editor restores its map, date, and saved values.
Unsaved form changes are discarded when leaving the editor or refreshing.

## Core features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Temperature chart** | Basal body temperature plotted on a fixed 0.05 °C grid, with influence factors and optional measurement-time adjustment. |
| **Daily observations** | Track bleeding, spotting, clots, mucus, cervix observations, sex and additional symptoms. |
| **Manual interpretation** | Place fertile days, coverlines, peak markers and BBT / mucus / cervix markers yourself. |
| **Cycle map** | Review temperature and observations together on one day-by-day timeline. |
| **Calendar** | Navigate through days and see menstruation and fertile-day highlighting at a glance. |
| **Multiple maps** | Create, rename, close, reopen and filter separate cycle maps. |
| **Day summary** | Open a read-only overview of everything recorded for a selected day. |
| **Local storage** | Data currently stays in the browser using `localStorage`. |
| **Map sharing and restore** | Export individual maps with their saved profile and import shared maps without replacing existing data. |

## Daily tracking

Instead of one large form, observations are divided into focused editors. This keeps data entry clear while all information remains attached to the same day.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="assets/readme/edit-day.jpeg" alt="Edit day menu"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="assets/readme/mucus.jpeg" alt="Mucus observation editor"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><sub>Edit individual observation categories</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Structured mucus observations</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Temperature entries can include an influence factor and a different measurement time. The app can show a rough time-based adjustment while preserving the original measurement.

Cervix observations cover **firmness, height and openness**. Mucus observations include **sensation, slipperiness, discharge, consistency and color**, including a free-text option when a fixed category is not enough.

## Manual fertile range

Fertile days are selected directly from a calendar and do not need to form one continuous range. The selected days are then highlighted across the interface as visual context.

## Day overview

Any selected date can be opened as a read-only summary, making it possible to review the complete daily record without reopening every editor.

## Maps and profile

Cycle data is organized into named maps. Only one map is active at a time, while previous maps remain available for later review.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="assets/readme/my-maps.jpeg" alt="Saved cycle maps"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="assets/readme/profile.jpeg" alt="User profile"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><sub>Saved maps with filtering and map management</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Profile and measurement settings</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The main menu provides direct access to the profile, saved maps, map creation and the currently active map.

## Design principles

**Interpretation over automation.** The app provides the working surface; it does not replace the user's judgment.

**Visualization over prediction.** There are no predicted ovulation dates, fertility scores or algorithmic confidence levels.

**Transparency over hidden calculations.** Values shown on the map come from data entered by the user. Manual elements such as coverlines and fertile days stay explicitly user-controlled.

**Privacy by default.** The current prototype stores its data locally in the browser and does not require a remote account or backend.

## Tech stack

`JavaScript` · `HTML5 Canvas` · `CSS` · `Vite` · `localStorage`

The frontend is built with **vanilla JavaScript and ES modules** without a framework.

## Local development

Requires **Node.js 20.19+** and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Run the project checks before committing:

```bash
npm run check
```

Development uses two branches:

- `main` — stable releases
- `develop` — ongoing development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repository workflow and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

## Data storage

The current prototype stores profile data, maps, daily observations, coverlines, fertile days and the active map identifier locally in the browser using `localStorage`. No account or server is required.

Each saved map captures a profile snapshot and has an **Export** action in **My Maps**, allowing maps to be shared separately as identifiable JSON backup files. **Import map** validates a shared backup and asks for confirmation before adding it to My Maps. The recipient's profile, existing maps and active map are preserved, while opening the imported map displays the profile saved by its author. If reading, validation, or persistence fails, existing data is preserved.

A database-backed persistence layer is planned for a future version.

## Disclaimer

Cycle Tracker is an educational tracking and visualization project. It is **not a medical device** and does not provide medical advice, contraception guidance or an automated assessment of fertility.
